# STL Scaling Feature

## Overview

The STL Analysis & Electroplating Calculator now includes a powerful scaling feature that allows you to scale your 3D objects and automatically update all calculations including surface area, volume, cost estimates, and electroplating parameters.

## Features

### üéØ Real-time Scaling
- **Uniform Scaling**: Scale the object equally in all dimensions (X, Y, Z)
- **XYZ Scaling**: Scale each dimension independently
- **Visual Feedback**: See the scaled object in the 3D viewer immediately
- **Preset Scales**: Quick access to common scale factors (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)

### üìä Automatic Calculation Updates
When you scale an object, all calculations are automatically updated:
- **Surface Area**: Updates for cost calculations and electroplating
- **Volume**: Updates for material cost estimates
- **Electroplating Parameters**: Current requirements, plating time, material needs
- **Cost Estimates**: All cost calculations reflect the new size

### üé® User Interface
- **Intuitive Controls**: Sliders and input fields for precise control
- **Current Scale Display**: Always see the current scale factor
- **Reset Function**: Return to original size with one click
- **Refresh Data**: Update all calculations after scaling

## How to Use

### 1. Upload Your STL File
- Use the file upload component to load your STL file
- The 3D viewer will display your object

### 2. Access Scale Controls
- The scale controls panel appears next to the 3D viewer
- Choose between "Uniform Scale" or "XYZ Scale" modes

### 3. Apply Scaling
- **Uniform Scaling**: Use the slider or enter a scale factor (0.01 to 100)
- **XYZ Scaling**: Set individual X, Y, Z scale factors
- Click "Apply Scale" to update the object

### 4. View Updated Results
- The 3D viewer immediately shows the scaled object
- All analysis tabs update with new calculations
- Cost and electroplating estimates reflect the new size

## Technical Details

### Backend Implementation
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /sessions/{session_id}/scale`
- **Request Format**: 
  ```json
  {
    "scale_factor": 2.0  // Uniform scaling
  }
  ```
  or
  ```json
  {
    "scale_factor": [1.5, 2.0, 0.5]  // XYZ scaling
  }
  ```

### Frontend Components
- **ScaleControls**: Main scaling interface component
- **STLViewer**: Updated to display scaled objects
- **App**: Integrated scaling with all calculation updates

### Mathematical Accuracy
- **Surface Area**: Scales by the square of the scale factor(s)
- **Volume**: Scales by the cube of the scale factor(s)
- **Precision**: Maintains high precision for engineering calculations

## Use Cases

### üè≠ Manufacturing
- Scale prototypes to production sizes
- Adjust object size for different manufacturing processes
- Optimize material usage through scaling

### üí∞ Cost Optimization
- Test different sizes for cost efficiency
- Scale down expensive designs for prototyping
- Scale up successful designs for production

### ‚ö° Electroplating
- Adjust plating parameters for different object sizes
- Optimize current requirements for scaled objects
- Calculate material needs for various scales

### üé® Design Iteration
- Quickly test different sizes without recreating models
- Compare costs and parameters across scales
- Iterate designs efficiently

## Example Workflow

1. **Upload** a small prototype STL file
2. **Analyze** the initial mesh properties and costs
3. **Scale** the object to production size (e.g., 5x larger)
4. **Review** updated electroplating parameters and costs
5. **Optimize** by adjusting scale factors as needed
6. **Export** final specifications for production

## Benefits

- **Time Saving**: No need to recreate models at different scales
- **Accuracy**: All calculations automatically updated
- **Flexibility**: Support for both uniform and non-uniform scaling
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing analysis tools
- **Real-time**: Immediate visual and numerical feedback

## Future Enhancements

- **Scale History**: Track and revert to previous scales
- **Batch Scaling**: Scale multiple objects simultaneously
- **Scale Templates**: Save and reuse common scale configurations
- **Advanced Scaling**: Support for more complex transformations
